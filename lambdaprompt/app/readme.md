# Lambdaprompt App Version

This is a simple fastapi app that wraps lambda prompt

It offers:
(1) A server that you can register lambdaprompts against (both in code and via web interface)
(2) A database that stores the logs
(3) Endpoints to call prompts
(4) Endpoints to monitor prompts
(5) Endpoints to browse logs
